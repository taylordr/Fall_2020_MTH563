Homework 0 will train us to use organize our code, document it, and use GitHub.



Your assignment is to:

1. Create a new python file that is similar to the following file:
	
	'danes_module.py'

It should use your name and contain two functions that you've created.
Make 2 different functions and make sure they work!
Give them a descriptive name.
Push your file to Github into the folder:

	'code'


2. Modify the Jupiter notebook:

	'notebooks/HW0_MTH563.ipynb'

that is in the folder 'notebooks' so that it
(2a) loads your module (use a line similar to 

	'from danes_module import *'

(2b) then show that your functions work.
Push HW0_MTH563.ipynb to Github into the folder

	'notebooks'

and replace the file that was there (i.e., which you downloaded).


3. Create a documentation file similar to

	'danes_documentation.rst'

But that uses your name.
Push your file to Github into the folder

	'docs' 

4. In the file 

	'docs/source/index.html'

add a line that names your documentation filename under the line 17, which states

	'   danes_documentation'

Then push your file to GitHub, replacing file 'docs/source/index.html'.
